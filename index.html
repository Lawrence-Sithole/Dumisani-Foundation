        Our mission is to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds in
        Zimbabwe access quality education and enjoy sports activities. We do
        this by offering financial assistance for school fees, educational
        costs, food and transport. We also supply sports kits and equipment to
        encourage physical fitness and wellbeing. Furthermore, we support the
        construction of schools that serve the local community.
